# Blockchain

Blockchain is an emerging technology in present world. The fundamental utilization of blockchain techniques has a scope in financial services in an organization or private sector. Blockchain is basically relies on protecting the blocks of information in a manner like immutable objects which cannot be changed or hacked. In another words, blockchain is a ledger form of any financial transactions that is duplicated and distributed across entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

## Blockchain Development:

A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contains the data as an object in those blocks. The information which is stored in the block relies on the category of the blockchain. Further, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, digital ledger technology which is immutable in nature and mainly utilized in the scope of financial transactions. Blockchain has been utilizing over plenty of computers which makes in no altering of the transaction record retroactively which helps in eliminating changes in all subsequent blocks and consensus of the network. By utilization of blockchain technology there is no need of central clearing authority in the transactions. 

## Different Types of Blockchains:

•	Public Blockchain - No central Authority
Public Blockchains are decentralized technology which doesn’t have any restrictions, the verification of the transaction of records can also be performed.

•	Private Blockchain – At least one authorization is required
Private Blockchain is not fully decentralized technique and only specific heads can perform the task in a closed network.

•	Hybrid Blockchain – No permission required
Hybrid Blockchain is a mixture of Public and private blockchains which relies on both permissions based and permissionless systems with no alter in the transactions.

•	Consortium Blockchain – Controlled by a group
Consortium Blockchain is also called as Federated Blockchain, which validates, initiates, and receives the transactions. Both Public and Private blockchains are utilized.

There are various applications of blockchain in the current world likely, Bitcoin Block Transactions. In Bitcoin Block Transactions, there is no need of huge custom central authority permissions which makes lives easier and burden free. Moreover, the transactions are more accurate and secure at the same time. The mechanism behind the block transactions is like the information in a block will be stored as a transaction block likely sender information, receiver information, and the amount of bitcoins to be transferred. Moreover, these types of data transaction blocks will be chained into a single unit of blockchain and every block in the chain has its own hash value to maintain the integrity of the data.
