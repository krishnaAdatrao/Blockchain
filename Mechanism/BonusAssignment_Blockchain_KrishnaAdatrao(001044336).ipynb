This architecture is a cloud-based foundation which results in virtual performances of RAM, ROM, and plenty other specifications. While making any projects and research there is a need of huge data and CPU performances to make the progress running. Google came up with a great solution for this as Google Collaboratory which provides virtual CPU performance. Moreover, Colab is also provided with GPU and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) which gives high performance. However, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is also another best serverless architecture with great security services too likely, Firewall, ACL, CDN (Content Delivery Network). In addition, AWS is provided with AWS lambda services for programming purpose along with AWS Cloud Beanstalk which makes lives easier. However, Google Colab is more flexible for research perspective. \n",

The implementation of blockchain with block objects of transactions has been implemented and the transaction objects are generated into hash values to make immutable structure of blockchain. Finally, the validation of this hash values is also illustrated with the running implementation of the program."
